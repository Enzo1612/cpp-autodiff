# cpp-autodiff

A lightweight `C++` implementation of **Reverse-mode automatic differentiation**. This library implements a dynamic computational graph engine that tracks operations at runtime to enable gradient-based optimization, similar to the core logic of `PyTorch`/`MicroGrad`.

## TODO

- Using new is cool, don't forget to free memory (destructor). An alternative is to use a shared pointer...
